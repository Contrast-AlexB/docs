## Contrast for Visual Studio

Contrast provides visibility of vulnerabilities in your applications, and protects your applications against attacks. For applications deployed with the Contrast agent, you can access vulnerability information directly within your Visual Studio IDE. You're directed to the line of code inside Visual Studio, and can view more details in the Contrast application, which allows you to provide application security feedback to developers right at the time of development for faster remediation.
