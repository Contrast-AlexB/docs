## Fixes

* 


## Improvements 

* User onboarding got way simpler! Contrast now integrates with your Identity Provider (IDP) via SAML to create and authenticate users. Set default roles in Contrast for each user, let the IDP talk to Contrast directly, and voila! You can administer and scale Contrast while we do the work for you. (To set up an integration, go to the **user menu > Organization Settings > Single Sign On page**.) 

* Developers, rejoice! We've brought vulnerabilities directly into your integrated development environments (IDEs). If you use Eclipse, IntelliJ or VisualStudio, download the plugin from the respective marketplaces and follow the installation instructions.

* Contrast can instrument and report on vulnerabilities in applications that use VMWare Xenon.

* The Contrast Security Java Service Broker has been updated to support Pivotal versions 1.11, 1.12 and 2.0.
