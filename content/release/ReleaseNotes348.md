## Fixes

* View merged applications and attack details with appropriate application access control. CONTRAST-19960, CONTRAST-20154
* Bulk user upload feature works like a charm. CONTRAST-20452, CONTRAST-20068
* Service Keys work in the right organizations. CONTRAST-20254
* Successfully sort attack events to get the best view. CONTRAST-19751
* Add any Reporter you want, and send vulnerabilities through your JIRA integrations CONTRAST-19497
* Add an application to multiple access groups during onboarding. CONTRAST-19983
* Get notifications for new comments on vulnerabilities. CONTRAST-20223
* Send all your bugs to TFS through a re-tuned integration. CONTRAST-19777
* SuperAdmins can test and save Internet Settings without any issues. CONTRAST-20012
* Smoothly delete multiple vulnerabilities. CONTRAST-12211
* Observer-level users can export vulnerabilities and manage comments. CONTRAST-16929
* Filter vulnerabilities by application, and get more accurate results. CONTRAST-19040   

## Improvements 

* We moved your [API credentials](user-account.html#profile) to your My Account info at the bottom of the **Profile** page. (Admins can still manage them from [Organization](admin-orgsettings.html#apikey) and [System Settings](admin-systemsecurity.html#manage-api).) 

 *These are your credentials. There are many like it, but this one is yours.*

* Enable Protect for users with a simple toggle (or spreadsheet column) while [creating their accounts](admin-onboardteam.html#create-user). Your new users can see attacks on their applications without any delay! 

* Edit any part of the Request URL before replaying the HTTP request. You can then replay the request (with the new URL) directly from Contrast.
