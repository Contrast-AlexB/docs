## Fixes

*  


## Improvements 

* Remediation Policies have a new outcome: [automatically remediate a vulnerability](admin-policymgmt.html#remediate). After you select this option, Contrast will change the vulnerability status to “Auto-Remediated”, if it hasn’t rediscovered the vulnerability by your given deadline. 

* Tag vulnerabilities, applications, servers or libraries automatically from any agent - just like you wanted. (Hint: This practice is especially helpful when multiple groups are working within Contrast and want to quickly filter without taking the time for manual tagging.)

* Set our .NET agents to a pending update state when a new agent is available. In this state, .NET agents will wait for users to restart their IIS servers before installing an update.

* We added CVE Shields for the following vulnerabilities in Ruby Gems: CVE-2017-0898, CVE-2017-14033, CVE-2017-14064.

* Choose which [vulnerability](user-apps.html#vulns) and [library](user-apps.html#libraries) data fields to export. The power is yours.

* Just like JIRA, but for our VSTS users: vulnerabilities status are updated in Contrast when you change the status of a VSTS ticket.
