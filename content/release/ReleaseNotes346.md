## Improvements 

* Ever wondered if you could apply different [Assess Rules](admin-policymgmt.html#assess) to different applications? What if you want to track SQLi vulnerabilities on one application but not on another? With Assess Rules by application, your dreams for Java, Node and Ruby can come true. (And .NET will be coming soon!)

* Donâ€™t be confused by different applications with the same display name. Contrast now requires [unique display names](user-apps.html#addapp), and will update your old ones for you. 
 
* If you have Node applications using Protect, say hello to three new rules: Server-side Javascript, Path Traversal and Command Injection. Head over to the Policy Management page to flip them on or off.
