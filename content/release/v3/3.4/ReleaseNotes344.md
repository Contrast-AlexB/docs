Yeah, yeah, yeah...

## Fixes

* 
 
## Improvements 

* Our response to Struts2 vulnerabilities: An update to Contrast on September 9 that adds CVE 2017-9805 to our library inventory data as well as an update to our Protect deserialization rule to stop attackers from exploiting this particular vulnerability.

* Contrast now supports user authentication using Active Directory Federation Services! To set up the feature, download the *pem* file from your SAML provider, and upload it your **Single Sign-On** page in Contrast. 

* We revamped your views of vulnerabilities: redundant trace details - like string operations - are now collapsed, formatting is enhanced and traces are presented more accurately. 

<!-- * Automatically export any new vulnerability to [JIRA](admin-orgintegrations.html#jira), [Team Foundation Server (TFS) or Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS)](admin-orgintegrations.html#vsts-tfs) with the check of a box. You set the threshold for vulnerabilities based on rules or severity, and Contrast exports new vulnerabilities over whenever they meet the criteria. -->

* Imagine if you could create hundreds - no, thousands - of users at the push of a button...and now you can! Just [put your usersâ€™ details in a CSV file](admin-onboardteam.html#create-user), and upload it to Contrast. Contrast creates all of the users and grants them access. 

<!-- * Go off the grid with more [library](user-apps.html#libraries) and [vulnerability data]() without any extra hassle. Just click the export icons in the respective pages, and download the spreadsheets with new and improved fields.  -->

* Have a customized VSTS/TFS URL? No problem. Head over to the **Integrations** page to set up your bugtracker.
