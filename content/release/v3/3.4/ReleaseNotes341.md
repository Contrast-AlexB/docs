## Improvements 
* Set environment-specific [defaults for servers](admin-orgsettings.html#org-server) before they even come online! 
* We added Compliance Policies to help you watch out for noncompliant applications based on rules or security standards like DISA STIG, PCI DSS or OWASP Top-10.
* Contrast supports x509 client certificate authentication through a [Trusted HTTPS proxy](installation-setupauth.html#http-proxy)
* Our new vulnerability standards filter in the Vulnerability Trend Report lets you sort your applications by security standards.
* Protect log events now have the application name embedded in them for easier identification with other events. If only those phone numbers from last night were so easy...
* New user default for Access Control groups helps roles avoid a nasty collision. (Unless, you know, you want to...)
