## Fixes

* 

## Improvements 

* xAdmins can now set Protect policies before licensing and onboarding any application. Go to the Protect Rules page to quickly configure rules for any environment.
 
* The .NET agent no longer supports instrumentation through the Profiler API and only uses Duplex technology: a patented mechanism that allows us to coexist peacefully with your other favorite .NET agents.
 
* We’ve added every pirate’s favorite ASP.NET library, SignalR, to our list of supported technologies, so you can rest assured that your application’s real-time web functionality is secure with Contrast.

* Search attacks and attack events by ID, just like you search for vulnerabilities.
