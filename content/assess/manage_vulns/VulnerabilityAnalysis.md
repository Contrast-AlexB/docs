Contrast will provide you information on what code flaws were discovered when navigating your application. We let you know exactly where in the code the vulnerability was found and how the code was used. Vulnerabilities will be presented and classified with a severity to help you manage and prioritize next steps. From there, you'll need to analyze these findings, track the findings, and get them remediated so that your application is secure. 

## Analyze & Manage Findings
The **Vulnerabilities** page allows you to search, sort and sift through all an application's vulnerabilities. As these weaknesses are discovered, Contrast provides guidelines for determining how to resolve them to prevent an attack. As you triage, you can mark a status and create tags as needed. For more information, read our articles [Analyze Vulnerability Findings](user_vulns.html#analyze), and [Manage Vulnerabilities](user_vulns.html#manage).

## Track Vulnerabilities
Make sure you keep track of the discovered vulnerabilities for planning and maintaining fixes to prevent attacks. Send vulnerabilities to bugtracker integrations, which your organization administrator can set up, or by email to notify or inform users who don't have access to Contrast. For more information, read our articles [Track Vulnerability Findings](user_vulns.html#track).

## Remediate Vulnerabilities
Delving into vulnerability will provide you with more details. Contrast provides an explanation of why it was flagged a nd guidance on potential solutions and techniques to resolve the vulnerability. Contrast also provides a **How To Fix** section which gives steps on resolving the issue. For more information, read our articles [How to Fix Vulnerabilites](user_vulns.html#remediate).
