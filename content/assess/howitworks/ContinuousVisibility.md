Contrast Assess is a revolutionary application security testing tool that combines Static, Dynamic, and Interactive Application Security Testing (SAST, DAST and IAST), to provide highly accurate & continuous information on security vulnerabilities in your applications.
 
In a fast-paced DevOps software world where applications are deployed iteratively, scarce security expertise can be a bottleneck. Contrast helps perform testing quickly and accurately by using an agent that instruments applications with sensors. The sensors look at data flow in real time and analyze the application from within, helping figure out vulnerabilities in:

* Libraries, frameworks, and custom code
* Configuration information
* Runtime control and data flow
* HTTP requests and responses
* Backend connections

## Instrumentation
When an application is deployed with the Contrast agent, Contrast code is inserted in to the application’s existing methods across custom code and libraries. These sensors are hooked in based on where data enters and leaves the application. Consequently, Contrast now has visibility into any data that flows through the application. When we detect a security flaw or vulnerability in this code path, it is immediately reported to Contrast’s central web application console. 

## Integrated App Security
Contrast provides real-time visibility to vulnerabilities, since it becomes a part of the application itself. It can now be used in existing Application Security and DevOps processes across the software development lifecycle (SDLC). 

Contrast is integrated into CI / CD tools preferred by roles across the SDLC, including Development, Security, and Operations:

* **Build tools:** Contrast integrates with Continuous Integration tools such as Jenkins, Maven, Gradle, and Bamboo. When the number of vulnerabilities of a specified severity exceeds a pre-defined threshold, Contrast can instruct the CI tool to fail the build. 
* **Team communications & bug tracking tools:** Apart from email, Contrast can send notifications and alerts via popular messaging and communications channels including Hipchat, and Slack. For customers in a DevOps environment, we integrate with bug tracking tools such as Jira, Serena Business Manager, and Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services / Team Foundation Services.
