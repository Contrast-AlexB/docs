If you've added a user to a Microsoft Active Directory or LDAP group, but Contrast still says that they can't be found, maybe you've added them to both the User and SuperAdmin groups. (Hint: This is not allowed.)

For more information about configuring these authentication methods, go to the [Authentication page](installation-setupauth.html).
