Through the SuperAdmin role, users are able to grant licensing to there select organizations through the [Organizations](user_tsguideset.html#orgs) tab. Through this tab SuperAdmin's also have the ability to:

* Grant licenses to selected organizations
* View organization details
* View licensing summaries 
* Revoke licenses 
* Lock / Unlock organiations  
* Manage an organization through [Impersonation](user_tsguideset.html#orgs)







## Granting Licenses
Users are able to grant multiple assessment and protection licenses to their organizations through granting licenses.

During this process the SuperAdmin is able to grant the number of assessment and protection licenses they want for that select organization, followed by a calendar allowing them to choose the date in which these licenses will expire. 

The user does have a choice of updating their [EOP License file](admin_tsfaq.html#license).
