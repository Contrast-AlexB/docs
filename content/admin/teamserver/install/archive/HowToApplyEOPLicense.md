In order to allow you to choose which applications you spend a license on, all applications are set to the **Trial** level by default. To gain access to all of Contrast's features and information about your application, you will need to apply a license to that application. This can be done in a few simple steps:

1. Browse the application you wish to monitor. Contrast will need a record of the application in order for you to select it for license application.

2. Lot into the Contrast TeamServer and browse to the **Applications** page, accessed by clicking the **Applications** link in the header bar. You should see a screen similar to this one:

3. Select the **Apply License** option in the row of the application you wish to upgrade. Doing so should open a prompt asking you to confirm spending a license on the application.

4. Click the **Apply License** option in the popup and you should see a message saying the license has been applied. The page will refresh and the License level of the application should now say **Enterprise**.

5. Log out of the TeamServer and log back in so that your session will reflect the newly applied license.

6. You should now have full access to the vulnerabilities reported for that application as well as access to all features Contrast has to offer.
