## Update IP Address
Updating Contrast's IP address is fairly straightforward. Whether you moved the installation or had to change the hostname or IP address, letting Contrast know is a matter of a few simple steps:

1. Log in as the SuperAdmin
2. Browse to the **System Settings** page
3. Select **General Settings** 
4. Change the TeamServer URL to ***IP:port/Contrast***
5. Click ***Save Configuration***
6. [Restart Contrast](installation_setupinstall.html#restart) to apply the changes


>**Note:** You will have to replace your agents so they know which new address to report to
