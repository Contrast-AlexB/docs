As Contrast assesses your applications, it can also flag libraries that may not meet criteria expected by your organization to ensure their applications are secure.

## Overview
Users can define policies for library version requirements. If a library used in an application is below a specific version, or is a restricted library, they will be marked as a policy violation by Contrast. Additionally, any library that fails the policy can be automatically graded with the letter F to bring attention to it on the Contrast UI. Administrators are also notified of violations both in the product and via email.
