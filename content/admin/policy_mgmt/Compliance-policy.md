As you add libraries to your organization, Contrast can flag the ones that no longer meet your criteria for maintaining security. 

## How it Works

Administrators can define policies for application compliance with their organization based on selected Policy Criteria, including Assess rules and vulnerability severity, and specific Applications. If any applications violate this policy, Contrast marks them in the interface so that you can find them and fix them. (Administrators are also notified of violations both in the product and by email.)

## Set Up Policies

#Edit policies

Click on a policy name in the Compliance policy grid to edit your criteria. In the **Edit Compliance Policy** form, click in the multiselect fields to change your selections. 

You can also enable or disable a policy using the toggle in each grid row. 

## Policy Violations 

Go to the **Applications** page...

Click the **Advanced** link to filter application by Compliance policy. (This filter is only available when one or more policies are enabled, and only displays those enabled policies.)
