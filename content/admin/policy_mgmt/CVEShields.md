Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) shields provide a standardized identifier for a given vulnerability or exposure. It also provies a baseline for evaluating the coverage of your tools. Contrast offers a number of CVEs to help protect you. Organization and Policy (Rules) administrators can adjust how they are applied throughout your portfolio by going to **Policy Management** from the user menu and selecting CVE Shields from the left navigation.

CVE shields are configured the same way as [Protect Rules](admin-policymgmt.html#protect), but instead of detecting categories of attacks, they defend specific CVEs from attack. This is a great feature for legacy apps with vulnerable libraries that are difficult to update.

Here is the list of CVEs that we defend with built-in CVE Shields:
