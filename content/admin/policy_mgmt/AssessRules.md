Assess Rules can detect specific types of vulnerabilities, such as SQL Injection or Cross site scripting, in an application. These rules are language specific, and can be turned on or off for each environment and each application. 

## How It Works

Contrast provides out-of-the-box rules that can be applied to your applications. Each rule is categorized with a severity as well as a description to provide more information.

Enabling an Assess Rule is as simple as flipping a switch from the application overview page. Organization or Rules Admins can configure Assess Rules from the **Policy Management** page, where you can see how the rules are being applied across your portfolio. 

## Set Up Assess Rules

### Policy Management 

View Assess Rules by going to the **User menu > Policy Management > Assess Rules tab**.

### Application page

View Assess Rules by going to the **Applications page grid > Rules tab > Assess toggle**. Use the search field to find a rule by name.

<!-- To view Assess Rules specific to an application language, Contrast provides a quick view alongside the rule search. Once you find the rule you want to edit, each rule can be configured per server environment. Modify the toggle switch in the environment you want to set. The agents will then apply the correct behavior.
