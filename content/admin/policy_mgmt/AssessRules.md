Assess Rules can detect specific types of vulnerabilities, such as SQL Injection, or Cross site scripting, in an application. These rules are language specific and can be turned on or off for each environment. 

Contrast provides out-of-the-box rules that can be applied to your applications. Each rule is categorized with a severity as well as a description to provide more information.

## Enabling an Assess Rule
Enabling an Assess Rule is as simple as flipping a switch from the application portfolio view. Assess Rules can be configured by organization administrators or Rules Admin users from the **Policy Management** page, accessible from the user menu. You'll be able to see how assess rules are being applied across your portfolio. To view assess rules specific to an application language, we've provided a quick view alongside the rule search to do so. Once you have found the rule you wish to edit, you'll notice each rule can be configured per server environment. Modify the toggle switch in the environment you want to set. The agents will then apply the correct behavior appropriately. 

>**Note:** For cases where more advanced rules are required, our customer support team can help set those up for you.
