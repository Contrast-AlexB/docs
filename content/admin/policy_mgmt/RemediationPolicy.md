As Contrast assesses your applications, it can also flag vulnerabilities that may not meet criteria expected by your organization to ensure their applications are secure.  
 
## Overview
Users can define policies for vulnerability remediation requirements. You can set a policy around any vulnerability type or severity, as well as apply it to any application(s) to ensure it is remediated within a set number of days. Any vulnerabilities in violation of this policy will be marked in Contrast. Administrators are also notified of violations both in the product and via email.
