Virtual patches are custom defenses that you can define to defend against specific vulnerabilities you may find in your code. You can specify the criteria that event needs to match as well as how the patch is applied. Virtual patches can be applied to specific applications or all applications using a specific technology (e.g. Spring MVC). Organization and Policy (Rules) administrators can manage these by going to **Policy Management** from the user menu and select Virtual Patches from the left navigation.
