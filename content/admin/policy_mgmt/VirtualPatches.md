Virtual patches are custom defense rules that you can define to protect against specific vulnerabilities in your code. You can specify the criteria that each attack event needs to match as well as how the patch is applied. You can apply virtual patches to specific applications or all applications using a specific technology (e.g., Spring MVC). Organization and Policy (Rules) Administrators can manage their virtual patches by going to the **User menu > Policy Management > Virtual Patches**.
