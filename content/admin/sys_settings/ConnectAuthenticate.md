## Update IP Address
Updating Contrast's IP address is fairly straightforward. Whether you moved the installation or had to change the hostname or IP address, letting Contrast know is a matter of a few simple steps:

* Log in as the SuperAdmin
* Browse to the **System Settings** page
* Select **General Settings** 
* Change the TeamServer URL to ***IP:port/Contrast***
* Click ***Save Configuration***
* [Restart Contrast](user_tsfaq.html#restart) to apply the changes


>**Note:** You will have to replace your agents so they know which new address to report to
