As Contrast becomes an integral part of your development lifecycle, it may become necessary to let users know when things like scheduled downtime will occur, or to let them know that an update has been applied and therefore agents should be updated to the latest version. System Messages provide this functionality to administrators. 

## Creating A New System Message
To create a new System Message, navigate to **System Settings** from the User menu at the top right and then select the **System Messages** tab on the bottom left.

The **Create a Message** button will generate a dialog allowing you to configure a system message to be broadcast to all users (either after login, or immediately if they are already logged in). This message will display until it is either deleted or reaches its expiration.

When a system message has been set, a user must acknowledge it before they can continue.


## Deactivating System Messages
Occasionally, you may expect something to take hours and instead it takes only a few minutes. In those cases you may wish to deactivate an active system message. To do so, simply check the box next to the message to select it and click the Delete button.
