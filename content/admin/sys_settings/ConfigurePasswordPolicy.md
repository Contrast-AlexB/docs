## Getting Started
We realize how important staying in compliance with your organization's password policies are, so we went to great effort to make sure Contrast wasn't a "step down" in that department. We included the ability to require many different factors in password strength from which you can choose "a la carte".

## Customizing your password policy
The password policy can be defined by the SuperAdmin, as well as managed by each organization adminitrator. The policy is managed via the Settings --> Security. 

Password policy includes attributes such as:
* Password length
* Password case
* Password numbers, symbols and letters
* Account active days
* Password usage days
* Password history retention
* Use of unique characters
