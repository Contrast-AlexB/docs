Once a user's account has been configured to gain access to multiple organizations via one or more organization groups, the user is presented with an option to move between organizations via the User Menu.

*Please Note*: Only EOP customers deploying in a multi-tenant deployment with two or more organizations are capable of manuevering across organizations.

Steps to toggle between organizations:

1. Log in to TeamServer
2. Navigate to the User menu at the top right of the screen
3. If the user has multiple organizations available via an Access Control Group, he or she will see a list of organizations to select
4. Select the organization of choice

> **Note:** Each organization contains settings specific to that organization. If a user is an organization administrator for multiple organizations, that user needs to toggle between organizations in order to configure settings for a specific organization.
