User permissions are dictated by access control groups. These groups provide the ability to define capabilities and restrictions to a set of users at either the System or Organization level. Permissions are defined within each access control group and leverage predefined roles as the input for allowing or restricting capability within the system.

## Viewing User Organization Permissions
Permissions per user can be reviewed via **System Administration > Users > User Permissions** by users with System Administration and/or SuperAdmin privileges. If a user has access to more than one organization, each organization can be viewed individually by toggling between them. In addition, applications can be filtered from the list. Each application states the user's role for that application, taking into account any application exceptions that may have been defined in an organization group.

## Viewing User System Permissions
Permissions per user can be reviewed via **System Administration > Users > User Permissions** by users with System Administration and/or SuperAdmin privileges. If a user has been included in a System group, he/she will see the organization as well as the organization role (No Access, SuperAdmin, Observer or System Administrator) that has been assigned.

## Viewing Your Permissions (Organization Permissions)
Each user can view their own permissions within their organization. Within the organization, simply select "Your Account" from the user menu. This will provide a detailed view of the assigned permissions. The matrix communicates the user's role for each application within the organization.
