## How It Works 

Choose default settings for applications in your organization based on levels of importance, existing policies and Assess licensing. Organization Admins can go to the **User menu > Organization Settings > Application tab** to get started.

## Set Up Defaults

### Importance 

Use the dropdown menu to choose an **Importance** level for applications. The default selection is **Medium**. 

### Policy 

Use the multiselect **Policy** field to choose which [Remediation](admin-policymgmt.html#remediate) and [Compliance Policies](admin-policymgmt.html#compliance) to apply to applications.

### Licensing 

Check the box if you want to **automatically apply Assess licenses** to newly onboarded applications. The thermometer chart below the checkbox shows you the number of licenses used out of the total number of licenses available in the organization. Click on the total number of licenses to go to the Licenses view of the [Organization Statistics](user-reports.html#orgstats) page.
