* Add a new **Incoming Webhooks** custom integration
* Choose the appropriate channel to which to send messages
* Copy the **Webhook URL**

To connect in Contrast:

* Navigate to the **Integrations** tab under **Organization Settings**
* Click **Connect** within the Slack row
* Name the integration and paste the URL
* Select the application(s) for which you want to enable notifications
* Click **Save**

You are connected!
