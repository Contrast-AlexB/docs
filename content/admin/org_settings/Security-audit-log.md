## Audit Log

Contrast captures activity about all user sessions, including changes to settings or licenses, actions on vulnerablities, and much more. To see a log of the activity in your organization go to the **User Menu > Organization Settings > Security tab**, and click the link at the top of the page to **View Audit Log**.

The grid shows the date of each activity and a message including the user's name and what they did. Use the search and date control fields to find specific instances within the log. 

Once you've found the information you needed, use the "x" icon to exit the log and return to the main Security page.
