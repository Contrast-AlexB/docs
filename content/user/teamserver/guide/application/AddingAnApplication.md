## Step 1: Clone Settings

After choosing a language, you have the option to customize your settings by checking off the **Advanced Configuration** box before downloading the agent. In addition to being able to delete and edit previous agent profiles, you can now **Clone** customized settings.

## Step 2: Container-Specific Instructions

We've simplified the information load by solely providing instructions based on the language and container you select.
