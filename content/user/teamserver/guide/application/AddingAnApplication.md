## Step 1: Download The Agent

After choosing a language, you have the option to customize your settings by checking **Custom Agent Profile** before downloading the agent. Choose a name for your profile and if desired, configure HTTP Proxy settings by checking **Use HTTP Proxy**. Once a custom profile is created, you can re-select it later from the dropdown or click **Manage Profiles** to copy, rename and delete saved profiles.

## Step 3: Restart Your Server

Before you begin browsing an application, we've added an additional step to ensure that you remember to restart your server.


## Step 4: Browse Your Application

In order to confirm that your agent was correctly installed, we display reported information from the server here.  Once you see information being updated, you may complete the wizard and begin browsing directly from the Application Overview page.
