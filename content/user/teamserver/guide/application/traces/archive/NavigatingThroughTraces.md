Contrast provides many ways to organize and filter the traces you see in the **Trace Explorer**, the tree component in the **View Traces** page that allows you to browse through your application's traces.

## Grouping

You can group traces together with the **Organize by** field. By default, they're grouped by the type of flaw, but you can group them by the URL that caused the trace, the methods involved, and more:

## Filtering

If you're marking up your traces' status (e.g. setting them to **Exploitable**, **Verified**, **Not A Problem**, etc.), you can also filter them that way:

<a href="assets/images/KB3-b04_2.png" rel="lightbox" title="Filtering By Status"><img class="thumbnail" src="assets/images/KB3-b04_2.png"/></a>

You can also filter by keywords throughout the entire trace:

<a href="assets/images/KB3-b04_3.png" rel="lightbox" title="Filtering By Keyword"><img class="thumbnail" src="assets/images/KB3-b04_3.png"/></a>

You can open up more filtering options by selecting **Show more filtering options**, and further narrow down the traces you want to see in the **Trace Explorer**:

<a href="assets/images/KB3-b04_4.png" rel="lightbox" title="More Filtering Options"><img class="thumbnail" src="assets/images/KB3-b04_4.png"/></a>

<a href="assets/images/KB3-b04_5.png" rel="lightbox" title="More Filtering Options"><img class="thumbnail" src="assets/images/KB3-b04_5.png"/></a>
