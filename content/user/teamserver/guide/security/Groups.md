Access Control Groups provide a convenient way to manage a collection of users. Users can belong to many groups. Groups are used throughout TeamServer; for example, they can be used to:

* Grant users system administration privileges.
* Grant users read-only visibility to system administration information such as users, applications and groups for an organization.
* Grant users access to organizations outside of their default organization. 
* Grant users varying roles by organization.
* Grant users varying roles by application. 
* Restriced from accessing applications within an organization.

## Viewing Groups
