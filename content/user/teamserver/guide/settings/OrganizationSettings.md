## About Organization Settings
Organization administrators have access to a menu of configuration settings specific for operating and managing users, servers and applications within an organization. Organizations settings can be found by selecting "Organization Settings" from the [settings menu](user_tsguideui.html#overview).

## Alerts
[Alerts]() provide a mechanism for users of TeamServer to construct rules and/or conditions to notify via email about the discovery of a vulnerability under a particular threshold or condition.

## Security
Organization administrators can manage [password policies](admin_tsconfigset.html#pw), [IP restrictions](admin_tsconfigset.html#ip) and session timeouts. In addition, the audit log is searchable based on keyword and date.

## API
Organization administrators navigate to the API settings page to email API keys, rotate keys and launch the [API Documentation Tool](dev_api3.html#openapi).

## BugTrackers
TeamServer offers basic integrations with various [issue and defect management systems](admin_tsconfig.html#defect): Bugzilla, JIRA and Serena.
