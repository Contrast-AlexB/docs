## Toggling Between Organizations
Once a user's account has been configured to gain access to multiple organizations via one or more organization groups, the user is presented with an option to move between organizations via the Settings Menu.

*Please Note*: Only EOP customers deploying in a multi-tenant deployment with two or more organizations are capable of manuevering across organizations.

Steps to toggle between organizations:

* Login to TeamServer
* Select the settings menu
* If the user has multiple organizations available vian an Access Control Group, he/she will see a list of organizations to select.
* Select the organization of choice.


## Note About Organization Settings
Each organization contains settings specific to that organization. If a user is an organization administrator for multiple organizations, that user will need to toggle between organizations in order to configure settings for a specific organization.
