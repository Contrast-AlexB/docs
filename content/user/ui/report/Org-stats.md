Pick from a collection of charts that organize data on your organization. Different views let you read it in your preffered language. 

To view information on Licenses, Applications and Servers, go to the Reports page via the User Menu. View the number of overall licenses for Assess and Protect as well as the the number of unlicensed applications and servers exist in your organization. Click the application count to go to the Trial/Unlicensed quick view in the Applications page. Next, view active applications. The inner ring designates the breakdown by language; select **Technology** or **Grade** in the dropdown menu to choose the breakdown of the outer ring. Last, but not least, view servers. Select **Container** or **Environment** in the dropdown to choose the breakdown. For more details on each category, select the **View** link under each heading.

## Licenses

The Licenses tab features a Consumption trend chart that displays data for the past 12 months. Hover over a data point on the Assessment or Protection trend lines to see how may licenses were available that month. 

The thermometer charts below display the total number of licenses purchased compared to the number being used, as well as a timeline of licenses that will expire. If you have no Protection licenses, you'll also see a count of unlicensed servers. 

For a different view of the data, take a look at the circular charts with breakdowns by fraction and percentage for Assessment and Protection.

## Applications

The Applications tab features a Status thermometer chart that displays the total number of applications broken down by the number of licensed, unlicensed and archived applications. Click on the total number to go to the Applications page for more details on each one. 

The circular Language Breakdown chart shows the number of applications by language (the inner band) and by either Technology or Grade (the outer band). Click number of active applications to go to the grid in the Applications page. 

The High Risk, Monitored and Expirations snapshots show the number of applications with critical open vulnerabilities, no protection and expiring licenses, respectively. 

Applications that you've added within the last week and applications in an offline server are listed in the sidebar.
