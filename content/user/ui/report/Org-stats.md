summary of administrative statistics on your Contrast installation. 

Go go to the Reports page via the User Menu to find information about licensing and breakdowns across various data points for onboarded applications; deployed servers and how theyâ€™re being utilized; and licensing to understand utilization and expirations. A collection of filters and charts let you organize the data you want to see and how you want to see it.

In the Licenses chart, view the number of overall licenses for Assess and Protect as well as the the number of unlicensed applications and servers exist in your organization. Click the application count to go to the Trial/Unlicensed quick view in the Applications page. 

In the next chart, view active applications. The inner ring designates the breakdown by language; choose the breakdown of the outer ring by selecting **Technology** or **Grade** in the dropdown menu. 

Last, but not least, view the Servers chart. Select **Container** or **Environment** in the dropdown menu to choose how the numbers are analyzed. 

For more details on each category, select the **View** link under each heading. 

## Licenses

The Licenses tab features a Consumption trend chart of data for the past 12 months. Hover over a data point on the Assessment or Protection trend lines to see how may licenses were available that month. 

The thermometer charts below shows the total number of licenses purchased compared to the number being used, as well as a timeline of licenses that are about to expire. If you have no Protection licenses, Contrast alerts you to the count of unlicensed servers. 

For a different view of the data, take a look at the circular charts with breakdowns by fraction and percentage for Assessment and Protection.
