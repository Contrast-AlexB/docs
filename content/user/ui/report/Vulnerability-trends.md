Vulnerability management is a vital responsibility of any security team. Recognizing the vulnerabilities your applications face and how well they're being managed can help you understand your security posture.

The report presents data about both newly discovered vulnerabilities and accumulated total vulnerabilities reported in comparison to remediations. The results allow you to prioritize vulnerability remediation efforts. Focus on the details that you care about by using robust filtering options to look at data over any specific applications, servers, Assess rules or by vulnerability severity. Contrast can also present data in various timeframes, ranging from the last week through the last year.

## Access Data
 
Select **Reports** in the User menu to go the Vulnerabilty Trend dashboard. Click the **View** link to see the graphs in more detail. 

Selecting **New** produces a graph of new vulnerabilities. Selecting **Total** produces a graph of all the vulnerability reported compared to all of the vulnerabilities that have been remediated. Hovering over each point in the graph generates a tooltip with the number of suspicious, confirmed and reported vulnerabilities on that date.

<a href="assets/images/Vulnerability-trend-total.png" rel="lightbox" title="Graph of total vulnerabilities"><img class="thumbnail" src="assets/images/Vulnerability-trend-total.png"/></a>

Each report defaults to "All" applications, servers and rules, but you can filter vulnerabilities by clicking in the fields above the graph. The following table outlines the categories that you can use to create a custom report. 


| Field        | Default      | Filter Options                                                                                              |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Date         | Last 7 Days  | Last 30 days <br> Last 12 weeks <br> Last 12 months                                                                   |
| Applications | All          | Importance (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Unimportant) <br> Application Tags <br> Licensed (List of all applications) |
| Servers      | All          | Environment (Development, QA, Production) <br> Server Tags <br> Servers (List of all servers)                         |
| Rules        | All          | Severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Note) <br> Vulnerability Tags <br> Vulnerability Rules (List of all rules)                         |

## Save Reports

You can save filter criteria to recall any customized report at a later time. Saved reports are at the User level, so each user has their own defined list of saved vulnerability trend reports. You can edit or delete these reports at any time.

<!-- Should step through how you save a report. Some details can be found in CONTRAST-12573.  --> 

When no report views have been saved, there is no dropdown menu next to the "Vulnerability Trend" header. The star icon is included on the right with tooltip "Save Report". Clicking the icon generates a popup with a field to name the report and buttons to Cancel or Save. Once saved, the name of the report is visible next to the "Vulnerability Trend" header with a dropdown menu. Confirmation message reads "Report saved successfully." Icon changes to star.

Note: Once at least one report is saved, the default when first coming to this page is the guidance text "Select report...". The dropdown includes an option to "Start a new report" as well as show the saved reports, separated by a horizontal rule.

### Rename a saved report

When viewing a saved report, hovering over the star icon generates a "Manage Report" tooltip. Clicking the icon shows popup with a field to rename the report and buttons to Cancel, Remove, or Save. Same confirmation message shows upon saving a new name. Report name updates next to "Vuln Trend".

### Edit and save an existing report

If you change the variables while viewing a saved report, the icon changes to a star and the word "EDITED" appears next to the report name. Clicking the icon generates a popup menu to "Save Existing" or "Save As New". Clicking "Save Existing" updates the current saved report view with the changed variables and the "Edited" status goes away. Icon returns to a star. Confirmation message.

To edit and save as a new report - same workflow as above - choosing "Save As New" generates the same naming popover. Saving updates the report name and the icon returns to a start. Confirmation message.

### Delete a saved report

Same workflow as above, except clicking "Remove" generates a confirmation dialog. Title "Remove Saved Report". Text "This will remove ReportName from your saved reports." Buttons to Cancel or Remove. Confirmation message "Report removed successfully." Report name changes to guidance text "Select report..."

### Create a new report 

When choosing the "Start a new report" option in the dropdown, the report name changes to say "New Report". Icon is a star because you haven't saved anything yet. This allows you to start over with the Vuln Trend report defaults. It also serves as a way to clear out of an edited state without saving or having to select another saved report.

## Manage reports 

The dropdown displays up to five saved reports and beyond that threshold, we have scrolling functionality and a search field. There is a "Manage" link on the same line as the "Saved Reports" label. Clicking this link allows you to rename or remove saved reports all at once within a dialog. Dialog title "Manage Saved Reports". Text to read "Click to rename, or select saved reports to remove." Saved reports are listed below with checkboxes. Names may be edited inline, and when checkboxes are selected, the names have strikethrough treatment and change color. The same threshold applies in this dialog regarding scrolling and a search field. In this case there is also a checkbox to "Select all" separated from the list by a horizontal rule.

## Export the report

Create a timestamped PDF report of the vulnerability trend to capture a snapshot your vulnerability management. Click the **Export** icon in the upper right hand corner of the Vulnerability Trend page, and Contrast immediately starts generating the report and prompts you to download when it’s ready.
 
Each PDF report provides the chart you see in the User interface along with a chart that summarizes the variables included in your customized view. It also summarizes the metrics and breakdowns of each data point.
