Vulnerability management is a vital responsibility of any security team. Recognizing the vulnerabilities your applications face and how well they're being managed can help you understand your security posture.

The report presents data about both newly discovered vulnerabilities and accumulated total vulnerabilities reported in comparison to remediations. The results allow you to prioritize vulnerability remediation efforts. Focus on the details that you care about by using robust filtering options to look at data over any specific applications, servers, Assess rules or by vulnerability severity. Contrast can also present data in various timeframes, ranging from the last week through the last year.

## Access Data
 
Select **Reports** in the User menu to go the Vulnerabilty Trend dashboard. Click the **View** link to see the graphs in more detail. 

Selecting **New** produces a graph of new vulnerabilities. Selecting **Total** produces a graph of all the vulnerability reported compared to all of the vulnerabilities that have been remediated. Hovering over each point in the graph generates a tooltip with the number of suspicious, confirmed and reported vulnerabilities on that date.

<a href="assets/images/Vulnerability-trend-total.png" rel="lightbox" title="Graph of total vulnerabilities"><img class="thumbnail" src="assets/images/Vulnerability-trend-total.png"/></a>

Each report defaults to "All" applications, servers and rules, but you can filter vulnerabilities by clicking in the fields above the graph. The following table outlines the categories that you can use to create a custom report. 


| Field        | Default      | Filter Options                                                                                              |

## Save Reports

You can save filter criteria to recall any customized report at a later time. Saved reports are at the User level, so each user has their own defined list of saved vulnerability trend reports. You can edit or delete these reports at any time.

To save a report view, click the star icon at the top right of the graphs. This generates a popup with a field to name the report and buttons to Cancel or Save. Once saved, the name of the report is visible next to the **Vulnerability Trend** heading with a dropdown menu.

The same threshold applies in this dialog regarding scrolling and a search field. In this case there is also a checkbox to "Select all" separated from the list by a horizontal rule.

## Export reports

Create a timestamped PDF report of the vulnerability trend to capture a snapshot your vulnerability management. Click the **Export** icon in the upper right hand corner of the Vulnerability Trend page, and Contrast immediately starts generating the report and prompts you to download when it’s ready.
 
Each PDF report provides the chart you see in the User interface along with a chart that summarizes the variables included in your customized view. It also summarizes the metrics and breakdowns of each data point.
