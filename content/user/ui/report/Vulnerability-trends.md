Vulnerability management is a vital responsibility of any security team. Recognizing the vulnerabilities your applications face and how well they are being managed can help you understand your security posture.
 
You can go to the Vulnerability Trend report by selecting **Reports** in the User menu. The report presents data about both newly discovered vulnerabilities and accumulated total vulnerabilities reported in comparison to remediations. The results allow you to prioritize vulnerability remediation efforts.
 
This report offers robust filtering options so that you can focus on the details you care about. You can look at data over any specific applications, servers, assess rules or by vulnerability severity. Contrast can also present data in various timeframes ranging from the last week through the last year.

<!-- <We may also want to touch on how they can filter tags, compliance requirements, etc.> as outlined in CONTRAST-12586.
 --> 



You can save filter criteria to recall any customized report at a later time. Saved reports are at the user level, so each user has their own defined list of saved vulnerability trend reports. These reports can be edited or deleted at any time. 
 
<!-- Should step through how you save a report. Some details can be found in CONTRAST-12573.

On-the-go? 

You can create a timestamped PDF report of the vulnerability trend to capture a snapshot your vulnerability management. In the Vulnerability Trend page, click the **Export** icon in the upper right hand corner. Contrast immediately starts generating the report and prompts you to download when it’s ready.
 
This PDF report provides the chart you see in the User interface along with a summary of the variables that are based on your customization. It also summarizes the metrics and breakdowns of each data point.
