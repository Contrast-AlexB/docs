Vulnerability management is a vital responsibility of any security team. Recognizing the vulnerabilities your applications face and how well they're being managed can help you understand your security posture.

The report presents data about both newly discovered vulnerabilities and accumulated total vulnerabilities reported in comparison to remediations. The results allow you to prioritize vulnerability remediation efforts. Focus on the details that you care about by using robust filtering options to look at data over any specific applications, servers, Assess rules or by vulnerability severity. Contrast can also present data in various timeframes, ranging from the last week through the last year.

## Access the Data
 
Select **Reports** in the User menu to go the Vulnerabilty Trend dashboard. Click the **View** link to see the graphs in more detail. 

Selecting **New** produces a graph of new vulnerabilities. Selecting **Total** produces a graph of all the vulnerability reported compared to all of the vulnerabilities that have been remediated. Hovering over each point in the graph generates a tooltip with the number of suspicious, confirmed and reported vulnerabilities on that date.

Each report defaults to "All" applications, servers and rules, but you can filter vulnerabilities by clicking in the fields above the graph. The following table outlines the categories that you can use to create a custom report. 


| Field        | Default      | Filter Options                                                                                              |

| Applications | All          | Importance (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Unimportant) <br> Application Tags <br> Licensed (List of all applications) |

## Save the report

You can save filter criteria to recall any customized report at a later time. Saved reports are at the user level, so each user has their own defined list of saved vulnerability trend reports. You can edit or delete these reports at any time.

## Export the report

On the go? Create a timestamped PDF report of the vulnerability trend to capture a snapshot your vulnerability management by clicking the **Export** icon in the upper right hand corner of the Vulnerability Trend page. Contrast immediately starts generating the report and prompts you to download when it’s ready.
 
Each PDF report provides the chart you see in the User interface along with a chart that summarizes the variables included in your customized view. It also summarizes the metrics and breakdowns of each data point.
