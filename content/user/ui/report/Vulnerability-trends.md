Vulnerability management is a vital responsibility of any security team. Recognizing the vulnerabilities your applications face and how well they're being managed can help you understand your security posture.

The report presents data about newly discovered vulnerabilities as well as accumulated total vulnerabilities in comparison to remediations. Focus on the details that you care about by using robust filtering options to look at data over any applications, servers, Assess rules or by vulnerability severity. Contrast can also present data in various timeframes, ranging from the last week to the last year. The customized results allow you to prioritize efforts toward vulnerability remediation.

## Access Data
 
Select **Reports** in the User menu to go the Vulnerability Trend dashboard. Click the **View** link to see the graphs in more detail. 

Select **New** to see a graph of new vulnerabilities. Select **Total** to see a graph of all reported vulnerabilities compared to all remediated vulnerabilities. Each point in the graph generates a tooltip with the number of suspicious, confirmed and reported vulnerabilities on that date when you hover over it.

###Filter vulnerabilities

Each report defaults to all applications, servers and rules, but you can filter vulnerabilities by clicking in the fields above the graph. The following table outlines the categories that you can use to create a custom report.

## Save Reports

You can save filter criteria to recall any customized report at a later time. Saved reports are at the User level, so each of you have your own defined list of saved vulnerability trend reports. You can edit or delete these reports at any time.
