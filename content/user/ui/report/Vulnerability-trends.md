Vulnerability management is a vital responsibility of any security team. Recognizing the vulnerabilities your applications face and how well they are being managed can help you understand your security posture.
 
You can go to the Vulnerability Trend report by selecting **Reports** in the User menu. The report presents data about both newly discovered vulnerabilities and accumulated total vulnerabilities reported in comparison to remediations. The results allow for prioritizing vulnerability remediation efforts.
 
This report offers robust filtering options to hone in on what you care about. Data can be looked at over any specific applications, servers, assess rules, or by vulnerability severity. It can also be presented in various timeframes from the last week through the last year.

<We may also want to touch on how they can filter tags, compliance requirements, etc.> as outlined in CONTRAST-12586.
 
Saving Customized Reports

You can save filter criteria to recall any customized report at a later time. Saved reports are at the user level, so each user has their own defined list of saved vulnerability trend reports. These reports can be edited or deleted at any time. 
 
Should step through how you save a report. Some details can be found in CONTRAST-12573.
