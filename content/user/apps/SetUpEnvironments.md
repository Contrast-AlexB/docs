Being able to better compare the differences across environments as code travels is a key piece to application security. Contrast provides constant visibility throughout the software development process from the second code is written to when itâ€™s pushed to production.

Environments can be set up from the **Servers** page. You can set the environment for each server to Development, QA or Production.

To view a side-by-side comparison on each environment for a given application, select your application from the **Applications** page. The Overview page sets up a shell for you to designate servers and once that's in place, Contrast can get busy finding weaknesses. You'll be able to identify and compare the security risks associated to each environment.
