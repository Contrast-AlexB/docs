The ability to compare differences across environments as code travels is a key piece to application security. Contrast provides constant visibility throughout the software development process from the second code is written to when itâ€™s pushed to production.

Go to the **Servers** page to set up environments. You can set the environment for each server to **Development**, **QA** or **Production**.

To view a side-by-side comparison of each environment for an application, select your application in the **Applications** page grid, and designate servers in the application Overview page. Once that's complete, Contrast can get busy finding weaknesses, and you can identify and compare the security risks associated to each environment.
