## About Licenses

Once you bring an application online, and it's reporting results, you may assign a license to the application. Without a license, vulnerability findings, application activity and a view of how the application is being used in real time aren't available. All applications in Contrast start with a temporary license by default. You can't transfer licenses between applications that are active or archived. To free a license from one application and assign it to another, you must reset and fully delete the licensed application. Once the application is deleted, the license returns to the organization pool. 

## License an Application

You must be an Organization Administrator to assign a license to an individual application. Follow the steps below to enable a license: 

* Log in to the Contrast interface as an Organization Administrator.
* Select **Applications** from the top navigation menu.
* Identify the application to license in the Application page grid.

> **Note:** Use the dropdown menu above the grid to filter applications by status.

* In the dropdown menu, select **Apply License**. <br> You can also click the **Unlicensed** link beside the application name, and then click the button to **Apply License** in the dialog that appears.

* The application is no longer marked as "Unlicensed" in the grid, and all findings are visible.


### Apply a license in an application page

You can also enable a license in an application's overview page. Follow these steps from the Applications page:

* Identify the application to license in the Application grid, and click on the application name.
* In the overview page, click on the **Unlicensed** link above the application name.
* Click the button to **Apply License** in the dialog that appears.
* The application is no longer marked as "Unlicensed" in the overview page or applications grid, and all findings are visible.
