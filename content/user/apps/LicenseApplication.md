## About Licenses
Enterprise licenses are assigned to individual applications after an application is brought online and is reporting results. All applications by default start as a trial license. Enterprise licenses cannot be transferred between applications that are active or even archived. In order to free a license from one application and assign it to another, the licensed application would need to be reset and fully deleted. Once that work has been completed, the license returns to the organization pool.

## Licensing from the Application Portfolio
Organization administrators are the only organization role capable of assigning an enterprise license to an individual application. Follow the steps below to enable an enterprise license: 

1. Log in to TeamServer as an organization administrator.
2. Select **Applications** from the top navigation menu.
3. Identify the application to license from the Application Portfolio page.
4. Using the gear icon at the far right of the table, select **Apply License**.
5. The application will subsequently switch from "Trial" to "Enterprise" and all findings will be visible.

## Licensing from within the Application
The license can also be enabled from an application's Overview page by an organization administrator. Follow the steps below to enable an enterprise license:

1. Log in to TeamServer as an organization administrator.
2. Select **Applications** from the top navigation menu.
3. Identify the application to license from the Application Portfolio page and navigate into the application.
4. To the right of the application name, you will see the word **Trial**
5. Click on the word **Trial** which will immediately prompt you to **Apply Enterprise**
6. The application will subsequently switch from "Trial" to "Enterprise" and all findings will be visible.
