## Step 1: Download The Agent

After choosing a language, you have the option to customize your settings by checking **Custom Agent Profile** before downloading the agent. Choose a name for your profile and if desired, configure HTTP Proxy settings by checking **Use HTTP Proxy**. Once one or more custom profiles are created, you can select them from the dropdown or click **Manage Profiles** to copy, rename and delete saved profiles.

## Step 3: Restart Your Server

Before you begin browsing an application, it is important to restart your server. We've added an additional step here to ensure that you remember to do so.

## Step 4: Browse Your Application

In order to confirm that your agent was correctly installed, we display reported information from the server.  Once you see this information being updated, you may complete the wizard and begin browsing directly from the **Application Overview** page.
