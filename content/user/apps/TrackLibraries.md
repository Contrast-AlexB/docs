Contrast uses Third Party & Open Source Library Assessment to identify libraries used, depth of usage and vulnerabilities that exist in them. We even detect vulnerabilities that are not already previously identified CVEs. This makes you aware of libraries that may be vulnerable which impacts the security of your application. Go to the **Libraries** tab in the application's Overview page to see a list of all libraries being used within that application or go to the main Libraries page to get a big picture of all libraries across your portfolio to manage them in bulk.

Contrast provides you with a grade for the library, known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), latest version and release date, used and total classes in the library, and the application that's using the library. Contrast calculates this grade based on three things: 

* Age of the library
* How many versions behind the library is
* Number of known CVEs that affect the library
