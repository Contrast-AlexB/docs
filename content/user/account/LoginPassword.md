Getting into Contrast requires the acceptance of an email invitation that you received from Contrast when you were onboarded by your administrator. Once you have accepted this invitation, you'll be taken into Contrast to log in for the first time. We'll walk you through a very brief introduction to reset your password, begin setting up your profile, and understand your role.

## Change Password
To change your password, do the following:

* Log in to Contrast
* Select **Your Account** from the user menu in the upper right
* Select **Change Password** in the left navigation
* Enter your current password
* Provide your new password which must adhere to the password policy set by your administrator which will be communicated as you type
* Check that you agree to the [Terms and Conditions](https://app.contrastsecurity.com/Contrast/static/html/tac.htm)
* **Save** your changes

The next time you go to log in, you'll need to provide this new password.

>**Note:** Customers using [Single Sign-On (SSO)](installation_setupauth.html#sso-setup) will not have this option.

## Two-Step Verification
If your administrator has enabled this capability, you may add an extra layer of protection beyond your username and password by using two-step verification. To do so:

* Log in to Contrast
* Select **Your Account** from the user menu in the upper right
* Select **Two-Step Verification** in the left navigation
* Enable the toggle switch
* Select your preferred notification method. You can access two-step verification codes via your Contrast-associated email address, or by using the Google Authenticator mobile application, available on the following devices:
	* [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en)
	* [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8)
	* [Blackberry](https://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/29401059/?lang=en&countrycode=US) 
* Download the backup codes provided if you run into issues using either methods
