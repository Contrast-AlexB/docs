Contrast is set up with the basics of your profile from when you created your account, but Contrast also provides some additional custom profile fields. Fill out your Contrast profile to help other members learn more about you and also help Contrast tailor the data presentation. To change your profile settings, log in to Contrast, click on the caret beside your username to go to the dropdown **User menu**, and select **Your Account**.

## General Information
