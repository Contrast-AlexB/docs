Contrast is set up with the basics of your profile from when you created your account, but Contrast also provides some additional custom profile fields. Filling out your Contrast profile helps other members learn more about you as well as tailor the data Contrast presents. You'll be able to add or change your name, modify date and time formats, select level of guidance you want to receive, and tell us what time zone you're in. 

To change your profile settings, do the following:

1. Log in to Contrast
2. Select **Your Account** from the user menu in the upper right
3. Modify any of the **General Settings** around your user avatar or time zone
4. Change any **Preferences** 
5. Make sure to **Save** your changes

## Upload Profile Image
You can upload a profile image, which you should because we know you have more personality than our default image. Use an image of your own or take advantage of one of our Contrast cats. This image can be updated at any time.

## Preferences
Contrast offers a couple elements in the UI to learn about updates or new features (What's New) and get inline guidance regarding new functionality (Quick Tips). These are helpful in getting release news at your fingertips and introducing features as you navigate in an unobtrusive way.
