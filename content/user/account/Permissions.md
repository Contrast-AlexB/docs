Each user can view their own permissions within an organization. To see your permissions, do the following:

1. Log in to Contrast
2. Select **Your Account** from the user menu in the upper right
3. Select **Permissions** in the left navigation

This will provide a detailed view of the assigned permissions for both the organization and the applications you have access to. Your organization will be listed at the top along with your organization role. The matrix under that communicates your role for each application within the organization. There is a help icon next to each role to provide you with details on what that role provides as far as available actions and access to data.
