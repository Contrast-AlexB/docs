Notifications provide a mechanism for Contrast users to be alerted in specific cases, such as the discovery of a vulnerability or an application being attacked. Contrast offers several out-of-the-box notifications which we believe to be essential to you. You can tailor those notification settings as needed. 

There are two primary channels available for notifications: E-mail and In-Application. 

* **E-mail notifications** Available if mail has been set up by your organization administrator 
* **In-Application notifications** Made available directly in the product and are visible by selecting the notification bell in the top menu bar.

To change your notification settings, do the following:

* Log in to Contrast
* Select **Your Account** from the user menu in the upper right
* Select **Notifications** in the left navigation
* Change one or more values

Below is a list of available subscription options:

* New Vulnerability: All or by severity (Low, Medium, High, Critical, Note, Library)
* Server Goes Offline
* New Comment
* New Asset Onboarded: All, Application or Server
* Email Digest: Daily summary of Contrast activities 

Organizations that are utilizing our Protect feature will also see:

* New Attacks: All or by attack status (Probed, Exploited or Protected)

>**Note:** You can narrow or expand the notifications you receive by adjusting which applications your subscriptions apply to.
