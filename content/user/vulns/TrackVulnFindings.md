Contrast gives you the ability to send vulnerabilities to bugtracker integrations or by email to notify or inform users who don't have access to Contrast. This allows you to plan and maintain timely patching to protect against attacks.

To set up bugtrackers and a bunch of other integrations - including Slack, HipChat or any generic WebHook integration - by selecting **Organization Settings** in the user menu and then **Integrations** in the left navigation. You can tell Contrast notify you if there are any new high or critical vulnerabilities found in your application.
