Contrast Security is the provider of accurate, continuous, real-time application security for your entire application portfolio.  
Contrast works within each application to make it secure during the entire development lifecycle with two products: **Assess** and **Protect**.

The Contrast agent begins securing your code by adding sensors to the entire software stack of your applications - from runtime to custom code - to directly measure vulnerabilities and attacks. Contrast Assess continuously monitors all your code, including your libraries, wherever it's running for known and unknown vulnerabilities. Contrast Protect blocks both automated and advanced threats attacking web applications and API, and immediately alerts you to the attack. 

To learn more about the ways that Contrast can keep your applications secure, continue reading about [Assess](assess-howitworks.html#assess-works), [Protect](protect-howitworks.html#protect-works) and [getting started with Contrast](installation-setup.html#quick-start).
