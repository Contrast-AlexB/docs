Contrast Security provides accurate, continous, real-time application security across your entire application portfolio by combining the best approaches of static, dynamic, and interactive testing into a single platform. 

Contrast works within each application and in cooperation with the tools you use to make your applications secure throughout the entire development lifecycle without any scheduling or scanning. 


Contrast infuses security into applications through the entire application stack, from the runtime to the custom code, and then watches for data flow to figure out vulnerabilities in your code.



____

Contrast enables your software to both detect vulnerabilities and block attacks through the Assess and Protect products. 

- Contrast inventories all your code, including your libraries, wherever it's running. 
- Contrast starts to quickly and accurately **assess** all your applications for known and unknown vulnerabilities
- Contrast can then **protect** your applications from both targeted attacks and bots


The Contrast agents adds sensors to the entire software stack of your applications to directly measure vulnerabilities and attacks.


From inside your applications, Contrast Protect blocks both automated and advanced threats attacking web applications and API, and immediately alerts you to the attack. 

Assess continuously monitors your entire application portfolio for vulnerabilities from the background while developers and testers do their normal job.
