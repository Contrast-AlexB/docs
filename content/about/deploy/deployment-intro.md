Contrast Security’s Quick Value delivery methodology is designed to reduce the time to achieve your desired business outcomes as well as to create a great onboarding experience for your team. With each of the steps outlined for Assess and Protect products, Contrast’s Customer Success representatives will continue to shepherd you through the setup and onboarding process. 

To expedite the process, information learned in the sales stage (e.g., your goals and desired timelines) is shared with Contrast's onboarding team, and progress and learnings from the onboarding stage is communicated to Customer Support. Contrast also simplifies the initial deployment for your team by consolidating multiple activities into a handful of meetings.

By reading through the guidance for each stage, you can also position your organization to improve its processes through the Contrast Security Maturity Model. 

## Contrast Security Maturity Model

The Contrast Security Maturity Model is a flexible roadmap to help organizations accelerate secure software development and production deployment. It's designed to guide your thinking and the dialog Contrast will have with you about your strategic vision for application security, where you currently stand and the appropriate target state for your initial Contrast deployment. Contrast's Customer Success representatives will help customize it to create the journey that's ideal for you.

Once introduced to Contrast in phase 1, an organization can easily move to phase 2 by installing Assess agents in QA, engaging developers on the new approach and increasing visibility of application risk to provide initial value. Moving to phase 3 involves implementing consistent security policy in Contrast - shifting vulnerability detection left in the SDLC - which reduces cost to fix vulnerabilities and improves the CISO-level view of risk. 

The final phase provides firm-wide security policy enforced through Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) and  using Protect to rebuff attacks, as well as the added benefits of reducing total cost of ownership (TCO) and accelerated time to market (TTM). By this time, Contrast is seamlessly integrated into the ecosystem of automated processes and tools. The following graphic is a theoretical example.
