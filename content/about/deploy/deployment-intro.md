Contrast Security’s Quick Value delivery methodology is designed to reduce the time to achieve your desired business outcomes as well as to create a great onboarding experience for your team. To ensure that you don’t have to repeat the same information to every new team, information learned in the sales stage (e.g., your goals and desired timelines) is passed to our onboarding team, and progress and learnings from the onboarding stage is communicated to Customer Support. Contrast also simplify the initial deployment for your team by consolidating multiple activities into a handful of meetings.

This deployment guide is an outline for your Project Manager and your team responsible for deploying Contrast’s Assess and Protect products. As you follow these steps, Contrast’s Customer Success representatives will continue to shepherd you through the setup and onboarding process. Overviews of features and workflows in Contrast include links to documentation and resources with additional details.

<!-- Each stage of the deployment has a brief introduction, recommended preparation that you can do to make the interactions with Contrast more productive, a summary of the objectives of the stage and a listing of the deliverables for that stage. --> By reading through the guidance for each stage, you can  also position your organization to improve its processes through the Contrast Security Maturity Model. 

## Contrast Security Maturity Model

The Contrast Security Maturity Model is a flexible roadmap to help organizations accelerate secure software development and production deployment. It's designed to guide your thinking and the dialog Contrast will have with you about your strategic vision (end-state) for application security, where you currently stand and the appropriate target state for your initial Contrast deployment; it must be customized to fit the journey that's ideal for you.

To illustrate the stages of maturation when using Contrast, this maturity model describes the objectives, organizational reach, phases in the systems development life cycle (SDLC), vulnerability management, remediation responsibility, policy and governance, key performance indicators (KPIs) and business value.

Once introduced to Contrast in phase 1, an organization can easily move to phase 2, by installing Assess agents in QA, engaging developers on the new approach and increasing visibility of application risk to provide initial value. Moving to phase 3 involves implementing consistent security policy in Contrast - shifting vulnerability detection left in the SDLC - which reduces cost to fix vulnerabilities and improves the CISO-level view of risk. 

Entering the final phase, Continuous, provides firm-wide security policy enforced through Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) and  using Protect to rebuff attacks, as well as the added benefits of reducing total cost of ownership (TCO) and accelerated time to market (TTM). By this time, Contrast is seamlessly integrated into the ecosystem of automated processes and tools. The following graphic is a theoretical example.
