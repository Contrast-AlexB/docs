Contrast offers two versions of the central management and reporting <!-- server -->: Enterprise-on-Premises (EOP) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). Contrast recommends that you use SaaS to accelerate and scale the benefits of Assess and Protect while taking advantage of the highest levels of security for your applications. 

## How It Works 

### Rapid response 

With the SaaS service, you can start using Contrast within minutes of [installing the Contrast agent of your choice](installation-setup.html#onboard). Just restart your application server, and immediately see Contrast at work. The SaaS environment provides you with the latest features, enhancements and fixes as Contrast continuously deploys them. As you add applications, Contrast scales automatically to meet your needs. You never have to to upgrade or manage additional software or hardware on your server.

### Enhanced security 

Your application source code and binaries never leave your servers. 

The Contrast agent of your choice analyzes software wherever it runs, and collects just the metadata
it needs to provide analysis and metrics.

<!-- The Contrast agent automatically reports application vulnerabilities to the SaaS TeamServer,
which displays critical security information, vulnerabilities, and remediation advice across all applications in a realtime
dashboard. -->

The SaaS <!-- server --> is Soc 2 complaint, and hosted in Amazon Web Services (AWS). (See a [full list of AWS certifications](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/).) All disk volumes storing Contrast data at AWS are fully encrypted with Amazonâ€™s EBS encryption.

The Contrast operations team proactively monitors uptime, and uses several industry-trusted monitoring solutions to measure the health, security, and performance of the SaaS service including Application Performance Monitoring, Workload Insights, Infrastructure Monitoring, Vulnerability Management, Threat Intelligence, Compliance Reporting, and Log Aggregation and Management.
