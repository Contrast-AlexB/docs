Contrast Assess is a revolutionary application security testing tool that combines Static, Dynamic, and Interactive Application Security Testing (SAST, DAST and IAST, respectively) to provide highly accurate and continuous information on security vulnerabilities in your applications.
 
In a fast-paced DevOps software world where applications are deployed iteratively, scarce security expertise can be a bottleneck. Contrast helps perform testing quickly and accurately by using an agent that instruments applications with sensors. The sensors look at data flow in real time and analyze the application from within to help figure out vulnerabilities in:

* Libraries, frameworks and custom code
* Configuration information
* Runtime control and data flow
* HTTP requests and responses
* Backend connections

## Application Assessment

Once your application has been assessed, Contrast presents a multitude of information, including:

* Accurate vulnerability identification that comes with details on the code and solutions to fix it
* Overall score to let you know how the application is performing in general - read about [Score Settings](admin-orgsettings.html#score-settings)
* Activity of the URLs being hit
* Application usage metrics
* Insight into the architecture of the running application 
* Third-part and open-source library assessment results
* Compliance reporting via PDF

## Contrast Assess Policies

There are two types of policies available in Contrast Assess. 

* [Assess Rules](admin-policymgmt.html#assess) which can detect specific types of vulnerabilities, such as SQL Injection or Cross-Site Scripting.
* [Security Controls](admin-policymgmt.html#security) which are methods in your code that make sure data is safe to use.
