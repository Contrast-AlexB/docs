## Setup an Account on the Contrast Hub
Enterprise on Premise (EOP) customers will need to request an account on the [Contrast Hub](https://hub.contrastsecurity.com) prior to installation. 

Hub is the central distribution system for customers to obtain installation media, release notes and licenses for EOP installations. To register for an account simply visit the [Contrast Hub Site](https://hub.contrastsecurity.com) and select **New User**. Make sure to fill out the required information to the fullest details and our Support Team will be notified of the account request. 

In most cases accounts will be approved and provisioned within 8 business hours. Notification will be sent via email requesting activation of the new Hub account.

## Download the TeamServer License File (Optional)
Your Contrast license file is configured with a **superadmin** account and a regular user account.  You'll need the license during the Contrast TeamServer installation process.
