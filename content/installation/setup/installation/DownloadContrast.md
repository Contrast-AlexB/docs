## Set Up Contrast Hub

Contrast Hub is the central distribution system for customers to obtain installation media, release notes and licenses for Enterprise-on-Premises (EOP) installations. EOP customers must request an account on Hub before installing Contrast. 

To register for an account visit the [Contrast Hub Site](https://hub.contrastsecurity.com) and select **New User**. Make sure to fill out the required information to the fullest details. Our Support Team will be notified of the account request; and, in most cases, accounts are approved and provisioned within eight business hours. Once approved, you'll receive an email requesting activation of the new Hub account.
