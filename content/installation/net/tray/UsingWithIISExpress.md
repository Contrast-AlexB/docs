Contrast analyzes IIS Express using the **Contrast.NET Tray**. If installed, the tray shows a tab for IIS Express, where you can see all the applications currently running on IIS Express in the **IIS Express** tab.  

Before agent version 4.4 (Contrast 3.4.3), users were required to start IIS Express via the Contrast.NET Tray to analyze IIS Express-hosted applications. With the release of version 4.4, Contrast.NET automatically analyzes any applications running on IIS Express, regardless of how the IIS Express process was started.
