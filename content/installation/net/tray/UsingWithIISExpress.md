Analyzing IIS Express with Contrast is performed using the **Contrast.NET Tray**. If installed, the tray will have a tab for IIS Express.

## Applications

The **IIS Express** tab will show all the applications currently running on IIS Express. 

Previous to agent version 4.4 (TeamServer 3.4.3), users were required to start IIS Express via the Contrast.NET Tray in order to analyze IIS Express-hosted applications. With the release of version 4.4, Contrast.NET will automatically analyze any applications running on IIS Express, regardless of how the IIS Express process was started.
